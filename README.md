# book-parse
Book Parse is an ultra-efficient Python string parser. 

bookparse.py can rip through the text of a book, count each letter, and organize them in a matter of seconds.  The sample text I've included (bookparse.txt) is the text of Alaeddin and the Enchanted Lamp by John Payne, repeated 35 times.
