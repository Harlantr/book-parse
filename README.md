# book-parse

Book Parse is an ultra-efficient Python string parser.

*bookparse.py* can rip through the text of a book, count each letter, and organize them in a matter of seconds. The sample text I've included (bookparse.txt) is the text of Alaeddin and the Enchanted Lamp by John Payne, repeated 35 times.

* Use -i to specify an input file location
* Use -o to specify an output file location
  * If no output file is specified, *bookparseResults.txt* will be created in source folder
